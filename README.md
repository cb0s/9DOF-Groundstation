# 9DOF-Groundstation
A simple groundstation showing the data from a 9DOF-sensor.

## Why is it needed?
There is a course at our university which requires a groundstation to display data from a sensor.
This sensor is a 9DOF-sensor (9 degrees of freedom), which makes this in many ways similar to the 
[rocketsound-project](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-rocketsound).

The 9 degrees of freedom are made out of the following parts:
 - 3 degrees for **rotation**
 - 3 degrees for **acceleration**
 - 3 degrees of a **magnetometer**

## What is part of this project?
The 9DOF-Groundstation consists of a frontend which is based on the
[telestion-client](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-client/)
and a backend based on the [telestion-core](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-core).

You might also be interested in the documentation which as of today, is far from complete.
It might be helpful anyway, so it might not be waste of time to take a look
[here](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-docs/).

## Will there be more features?
You might ask yourself if there will be added more features in the future. Currently, there are no plans developing this
package further than "just working". This however doesn't mean that *you* are not welcomed to extend it to your needs
according to the license (MIT).

## Cool, but how does it look?
